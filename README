This is a Python 2 based suite of tools for analysing SOLiD sequencing
reads with poly-A tails.

Use of PyPy is recommened for speed.

This package depends on "nesoni", available from 

   http://vicbioinformatics.com/nesoni.shtml

You don't need to install all of nesoni's dependencies, just Python 2.7 
or later or PyPy.


This package contains a number of tools, which can be listed by typing:


  python -m tail_tools
    

These tools may also be used as part of a nesoni-style workflow python script.
