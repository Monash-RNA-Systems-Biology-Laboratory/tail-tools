This is a Python 2 based suite of tools for analysing SOLiD sequencing
reads with poly(A) tails.

Use of PyPy is recommened for speed.


Requirements:
=============

- "nesoni", available from http://vicbioinformatics.com/nesoni.shtml or using

    pip install nesoni

  You don't need to install all of nesoni's dependencies, just Python 2.7 
  or later or PyPy.

- The "convert" tool from ImageMagick.


Installation:
=============

Easy way:

  pip install tail-tools

From source:

  python setup.py install

For PyPy it seems to be currently easiest to set up in a virtualenv:

  virtualenv -p pypy myenv
  myenv/bin/pip install tail-tools


Usage:
======

This package contains a number of tools, which can be listed by typing:

  tail-tools
  

The package can be used directly from the source directory with:

  python -m tail_tools


These tools may also be used as part of a nesoni-style workflow python script.



Tail-tools is free software, released under the GPL (version 2).
