This is a Python 2 based suite of tools for analysing SOLiD sequencing
reads with poly-A tails.

Use of PyPy is recommened for speed.

This package depends on "nesoni", available from 

   http://vicbioinformatics.com/nesoni.shtml

You don't need to install all of nesoni's dependencies, just Python 2.7 
or later or PyPy.


This package contains three utilities:
    
  python tail_tools/fasta_qual_merge.py
    - Merge FASTA and qual files into a single FASTQ file.
    
  python tail_tools/clip_runs.py
    - Clip poly-A tails and low quality sequence from the ends of SOLiD 
      reads before alignment.
    
  python tail_tools/extend_sam.py
    - If the reference truly did contain As, re-extend SAM alignments.
    - Mark SAM records of reads with with poly-A tails as such.
    

These tools may also be used as part of a nesoni-style workflow python script.
