This is a Python 2 based suite of tools for analysing SOLiD sequencing
reads with poly(A) tails.

Use of PyPy is recommened for speed.

Requirements:

- "nesoni", available from http://vicbioinformatics.com/nesoni.shtml

  You don't need to install all of nesoni's dependencies, just Python 2.7 
  or later or PyPy.

- The "convert" tool from ImageMagick.


This package contains a number of tools, which can be listed by typing:


  ./tail-tools
    

These tools may also be used as part of a nesoni-style workflow python script.



Tail-tools is free software, released under the GPL (version 2).
