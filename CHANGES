0.22 - "compare-peaks:" outputs utr before first peak as well as inter-peak sequence.
       Fix bugs in workflow.

0.21 - Major refactoring
       - define reference annotation to be GFF3
       - UCSC genome downloader

0.20 - "nodedup" -> "dup"
       Changes to reports.

0.19 - Fix setup.py

0.18 - Basespace read support.
       "call-peaks:" pipeline.
       "compare-peaks:" tool.
       "geneview-webapp:" gene expression viewer.

0.17 - Assignment of reads to features made more deterministic in "tail-lengths:"

0.16 - Thread tail statistics through outputs.
       "tail_length:" now only ever counts reads once, 
           uses only the feature with the greatest overlap of a read 
           rather than all features with overlaps.
       "compare-peaks:" now ranks by "interestingness".

0.15 - Added "compare-peaks:" tool.

0.14 - Extend_sam now requires 4 bases of tail rather than 3 to be marked AA,
       to be consistent with tail length tools (and observation that this is a better cutoff).

0.13 - Don't call file igv-plots.tar.gz.tar.gz,
       a single .tar.gz is sufficient.

0.12 - Bugfixes

0.11 - Update to use newer nesoni features, such as sample tags

0.10 - use distribute

0.9 - R+ doesn't like trailing newlines in text in plots sometimes, apparently

0.8 - use report from correct log files when using consensus=False

0.7 - don't re-run everything if number of cores changes

0.6 - analysis is now performed both with and without deduplication

0.5 - add "tail-stats:" tool
      extend_sam: fix out by one error for AA:i: attribute on reverse strand

0.4 - plot-pooled now produces a spreadsheet
