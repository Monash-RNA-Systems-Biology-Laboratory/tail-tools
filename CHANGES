1.9  - ANOVA and excess variation tests in Shiny test app.

       Options to clip tails at a certain length or require adaptor bases.

       Option to produce peak pairs including non-utr peaks.
       Reduced memory usage in call-peaks.

       Allow up to 60% mismatch on A extension in extend-sam-basespace.

1.2  - Allow raw poly(A) lengthh and templated width download from mPAT shiny report.
       Fix bug setting three prime bounds for cumulative read distribution plots (missing dplyr:: for lead and lag)

1.1  - Remove deduplication.
       poly(A) calling in reads no longer uses quality information,
           a sequence of 10 "A"s and/or adaptor sequence is called as poly(A) tail.

0.43 - Clip Illumina reads to a region containing 90% bases with quality at
       least 20. Poly(A) tails are only called within this region, this
       means we see less long poly(A) tails, so this changes the tail length statistics 
       quite a lot.
       Add shiny reports, end shift test in R.
       Bugfixes to plot-comparison, plot-pooled.
       make-ensembl-reference skips genes with transcripts on inconsistent strands.
       Control of clipping in pipeline.

       Fix very silly overuse of memory.
       Other memory improvements in aggregate-tail-counts.

0.39 - Bugfix with groups.
       More documentation of pipeline output.
       Include design matrix in report from "test:".

0.38 - Allow more parallelism for tail-count, memory usage doesn't seem to be severe.
       Check for duplicate sample name or duplicate read filename in "analyse-polya-batch:".

0.37 - Use Fitnoise 2 for testing.

0.36 - Prevent aggregate-tail-counts from running in parallel in pipeline.
       Call primary peaks as part of pipeline.
       Output a JSON file for Andrew and Jack's survival curver plotter.

       Don't put a lower limit on number of reads required to call proportion, tail.
       Improved tail length testing.

       "compare-peaks:" outputs "NA"s rather than "None"s in peak-pair file.
       Cleaned up reports.

0.31 - Remove collapse-features from call-peaks, not needed and causes later stage to fail.

       correctly link to genewise-dedup/peakwise-dedup

0.29 - Bugfix to "make-tt-reference:".

0.28 - Bugfix to "make-tt-reference:".

0.27 - Peaks were being incorrectly extended in pipeline, fixed.
       Added facility to perform a set of tests to analyse-polya-batch.
       "compare-peaks:" option to output longer pre-peak and inter-peak sequences.

       "compare-peaks:" tool.
       "geneview-webapp:" gene expression viewer.

0.17 - Assignment of reads to features made more deterministic in "tail-lengths:"

0.16 - Thread tail statistics through outputs.
       "tail_length:" now only ever counts reads once, 
           uses only the feature with the greatest overlap of a read 
           rather than all features with overlaps.
       "compare-peaks:" now ranks by "interestingness".

0.15 - Added "compare-peaks:" tool.

0.14 - Extend_sam now requires 4 bases of tail rather than 3 to be marked AA,
       to be consistent with tail length tools (and observation that this is a better cutoff).

0.13 - Don't call file igv-plots.tar.gz.tar.gz,
       a single .tar.gz is sufficient.
