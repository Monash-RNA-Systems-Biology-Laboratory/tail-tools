0.39 - Bugfix with groups.
       More documentation of pipeline output.
       Include design matrix in report from "test:".

0.38 - Allow more parallelism for tail-count, memory usage doesn't seem to be severe.
       Check for duplicate sample name or duplicate read filename in "analyse-polya-batch:".

0.37 - Use Fitnoise 2 for testing.

0.36 - Prevent aggregate-tail-counts from running in parallel in pipeline.
       Call primary peaks as part of pipeline.
       Output a JSON file for Andrew and Jack's survival curver plotter.

0.35 - Options for sample weighting and empirical controls in "test:".

0.34 - .json files accidentally omitted from report.

0.33 - Add average expression / average tail length column to "test:" degusts.

0.32 - Add "AD" property to BAM files, number of adaptor sequence bases observed.
       Don't put a lower limit on number of reads required to call proportion, tail.
       Improved tail length testing.
       Dropped Chi-Sq testing from "compare-peaks:", "test:" hopefully makes this obsolete.
       "compare-peaks:" outputs "NA"s rather than "None"s in peak-pair file.
       Cleaned up reports.

0.31 - Remove collapse-features from call-peaks, not needed and causes later stage to fail.

0.30 - Bugfix in report generation for "analyse-polya-batch:",
       correctly link to genewise-dedup/peakwise-dedup

0.29 - Bugfix to "make-tt-reference:".

0.28 - Bugfix to "make-tt-reference:".

0.27 - Peaks were being incorrectly extended in pipeline, fixed.
       Added facility to perform a set of tests to analyse-polya-batch.
       "compare-peaks:" option to output longer pre-peak and inter-peak sequences.

0.26 - Show p.value in "test:".
0.25 - Bugfix in "test:" tool.
0.24 - Add "test:" tool.

0.23 - Add --peak-min-depth option to workflow.
       Default raised from 10 to 50.
       compare-peaks output table lists relevant peaks.
       Gene viewer shows relevant peaks.
       Gene viewer shows 3' UTR position.
       Don't nuke pooled.csv.

0.22 - "compare-peaks:" outputs utr before first peak as well as inter-peak sequence.
       Fix bugs in workflow.

0.21 - Major refactoring
       - define reference annotation to be GFF3
       - UCSC genome downloader

0.20 - "nodedup" -> "dup"
       Changes to reports.

0.19 - Fix setup.py

0.18 - Basespace read support.
       "call-peaks:" pipeline.
       "compare-peaks:" tool.
       "geneview-webapp:" gene expression viewer.

0.17 - Assignment of reads to features made more deterministic in "tail-lengths:"

0.16 - Thread tail statistics through outputs.
       "tail_length:" now only ever counts reads once, 
           uses only the feature with the greatest overlap of a read 
           rather than all features with overlaps.
       "compare-peaks:" now ranks by "interestingness".

0.15 - Added "compare-peaks:" tool.

0.14 - Extend_sam now requires 4 bases of tail rather than 3 to be marked AA,
       to be consistent with tail length tools (and observation that this is a better cutoff).

0.13 - Don't call file igv-plots.tar.gz.tar.gz,
       a single .tar.gz is sufficient.

0.12 - Bugfixes

0.11 - Update to use newer nesoni features, such as sample tags

0.10 - use distribute

0.9 - R+ doesn't like trailing newlines in text in plots sometimes, apparently

0.8 - use report from correct log files when using consensus=False

0.7 - don't re-run everything if number of cores changes

0.6 - analysis is now performed both with and without deduplication

0.5 - add "tail-stats:" tool
      extend_sam: fix out by one error for AA:i: attribute on reverse strand

0.4 - plot-pooled now produces a spreadsheet
